                    why you do not agree with this decision. Appeals should be sent to the office listed at the top of this notice.
                    While an appeal is pending you must continue to certify for benefits for each week that you contend you are
                    eligible. If the final decision by the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board finds you eligible, you
                    can be paid only for those weeks you certified for benefits and met all other eligibility requirements.
